## Setting up your profile

Once you've set up your Bitexbot account, you might want to customize and add information to your personal **profile**.

Your profile is a personal information page linked to your Bitexbot account. Your profile can contain:

- **Basic information**, like your birth date and gender.
- Additional **contact information**.
- **Notifications** help you stay on top your **account's security**.
- **Connections** to social networking sites like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Filling in your profile is completely optional, and it's advisable not to add too much detailed personal information. However, filling in a little information can be useful in some situations. It's all about deciding how much you want to share.

We encourage you to turn **Notification** on, so we can send an email when you sign in to your account or when we place an order for you.
